 if we want ot create one server we have to import HTTP core module then by using the refernce 
of the core module we have to call create server method, which will tAKE ONE CALL back 
function and take request and responce objects as arguments 
and respone.end method it will treminate request and responce cycle.

then server shoud listen to a port 



************Fs module{
  sync function completes its operation.
incase of async the other thread will not wait

  

}

**********NPM{

npm stands for Node Pakage manager which is used to install thrid party modules and
for third party modules pakages.json file should be there in where  it contains
depe  


}


*****************Events{

event emitter.on wil take 2 arguments 1st as name and 2nd as callback function
}

buffer is the memory location which will store small chunck of data once the user consume
the data inside the buffer then it will loaded again



****************url{
URL stands for uniform resources locator which uniquely identify one applicaton over the 
network. 
primarily we have 2 type of urls 
1. web url(identifies one web application over the network)
2.DB url(identifies one Data base application over the network)
by using url we can acess one web resorces.

**************Diference Between Static and Dynamic web resources************************

1. static web resources will already present inside the application and 
   dynamic web resourece will generated after the request 
2. static web resources will not be change after n number of request
   Incase of dynamic web resources it may change or may not change
3. in order to acess a staic web resources we have to mention file name with the url
   in order to acesss a dynamic eb resources we have to configure the url
4. An web application with one dynamic resoures is concederd to be one dynmaic web application
   if all the web resources are static resources in one web application then it is conce
   dered to be one static web appplication
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_________________________________________________________________________________________
 ******structure of url -> protocol://domain:port/path?key=value &key=value#fragment
   
protocol-> It is a set of rules and regulation which 2 web application interact oneanother
domain-> It uniquely identify the sysytem name primarly a computer name
port(number)->port uniquely identifies one particular aplication inside a system over
	      the network
path-> uniquely identifies a patricular web resources inside a particular application
*queary params are used to pass data from frontend to the server it will be an key value 
pairs if i have more than one key value pairs we have to seperate them using &

fragment-> by using fragment we can navigate to a particualr sectin in side a html page

note: for browser protocol and port number these 2 are not mandetory

2.Form data
3.http methods
4.cookies in order to reqconize the user then server creates the server then if the same 
user will login it will provide the data

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
header (web url formdata http mehods)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
body(form data)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


key elements of http respone:
1.status code-> 200 status code=> server sucesssfully handles the request|
