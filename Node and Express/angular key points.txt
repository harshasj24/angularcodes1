reactive forms :

*in the model we need to crate a instance of a form group for a particular form 
and assign to a variable

*the form group will take 3 arguments the first argument will be the instnaces of chlid 
form controlls validators and async validators these 2 are optional

*after that we need to create an instance of a form control with key and value  where 
key is the formContolName and value will be the incantce of a particular child 

*after that we need to inculde our model in our view by using formgroup directive
and we need to add formcontalname for each elements in our view 
 
form group will always tracks the status of value ,validation and changes on the field
of all the child form control intances

where form control will only track individual input field of a particular form and ia basic
building block of a forms and it represents an individual form element of an form
